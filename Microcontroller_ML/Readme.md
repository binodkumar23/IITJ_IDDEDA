This project aims at the implementtaion of ML (particularly neural networks) under resource constraints of edge computing.

To illustrate the usage of this project, My students have added a NodeJS server code for storing the attendance of the students visible in the frame at 
any given time. The data will be sent to a MongoDB-based database. They have also hosted a website to show the attendance record through Heroku.
